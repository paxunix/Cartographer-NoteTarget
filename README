From my days playing World of Warcraft.  It was sometimes more fun to write
addons than advance in the game.

Cartographer_NoteTarget v0.3
----------------------------

Supply a slash command (/ctnt) to capture a few details for the targeted
unit and save them in a map note.

If you do not have anything targeted, typing /ctnt <something> will create a
note at your location with <something> as the title.
